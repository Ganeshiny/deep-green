# plant-go-predictor (WIP)

Plant Go Predictor (PGP) is a automated function predicting (AFP) model trained on specialized plant data. This model uses graph representations of experimental plant protein structure data and seqres records to predict fuctions as Gene Ontology (GO) terms. 


## To-dos

The model is predicting higher level GO terms, must do better class weight sampling to get more specific functions: Focal loss
