Deep Green (DG) is a automated function predicting (AFP) model trained on specialized plant data. This is a  This model uses graph representations of experimental plant protein structure data and seqres records to predict fuctions as Gene Ontology (GO) terms. 


## About
DG is a GCN-GAT deep learning model that is trained on plant protein chain dataset which consists of exclusively experimentally determined structures. The model outputs Gene Ontology (GO) terms for each protein chain.
